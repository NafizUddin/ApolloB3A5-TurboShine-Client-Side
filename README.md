## :sparkle: [Project Features](https://github.com/NafizUddin/ApolloB3A4-PowerFit-Client-Side)

There are some features in this project. Here I have provided some of them:

- Authentication - There is a `sign in` and `sign up` button in the navbar. By clicking the buttons, it will lead the users to sign in and sign up form. By putting the input values, users can login, sign up and enjoy all features of the website. Once they get signed up or signed in, their name and photo will be shown in the navbar.

- Upcoming immediate service countdown - If any user has booked a service, it will be shown in the navbar with a `countdown` timer considering the `date` and `start time` of the service.

- Featured Services - There is a `featured service` section in the homepage where users will find the featured services with a navigation button to see all the services.

- Customer Feedback Form - There is a `Customer Feedback` form in the homepage where users can give their valuable feedback and give `rating.` to overall website.

- Testimonials - The `average` rating of the website is shown and 4 customer reviews are shown with a slider in this section.

- Comparison of Services - There are a `tag` section in `Services` route and all services are shown as tags. Users have to select `minimum two` tags and a compare button will activate then. By clicking the button, a modal will be opened comparing between services.

- Filtering,sorting and searching of Services - Users can filter services by `price range` and `service time duration` in the `services` route. Users can also sort services based on `price` and `time` duration in `ascending` and `descending` order. Moreover, users can also search services by service `name` and `description`.

- Service Slot Availability - In each service details page, users will find the `service slots` of a `current date`. Under that section, users will find a `calender` to search for available slots for a particular date. By selecting one or multiple available slots, they will navigate to `Booking` section.

- Payment with Aamarpay.com - In the `Booking` section, users can pay for their booked services with `Aamarpay.com`.

- Dashboard as per Role - There is a `Dashboard` route in this website to manage all the features of this website.

- User Dashboard - A user will find his/her all `previous` and `upcoming` booked services. Previous booked services are shown in a tabular format and upcoming services are shown as a card. Users will find `countdown` timer in each card as a reminder of start time of the services.

- Admin Dashboard - An Admin can manage the whole website with the dashboard. He/she can `add` new services, `update` existing services and `delete` existing services and `view` details of the services. In addition, admin can also create new slots for a particular service by selecting `date and time`. Admin can also change status of the existing slots. Besides, there is a button to change status of past existing slots as `expired`. Furthermore, admin can see all the `users` in tabular format and `change role` of the users. Lastly, admin can also see all the `bookings` of services in tabular format

- Update Profile - There is a `profile card` in dashboard to see profile details and users can also update their profiles.
